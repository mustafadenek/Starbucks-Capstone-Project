    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "# Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)\n",
    "* profile.json - demographic data for each customer\n",
    "* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "* id (string) - offer id\n",
    "* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "* channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "* age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "* became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "* gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)\n",
    "* id (str) - customer id\n",
    "* income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "* event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "* person (str) - customer id\n",
    "* time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "* value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can. You can access the termnal from the orange icon in the top left of this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how to access the terminal and how the install works using the two images below.  First you need to access the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will want to run the above command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you enter back into the notebook (use the jupyter icon again), you should be able to run the below cell without any errors."

The objective of offers are to drive purchases, so it would already be the case that users with high spend in their transactions would be flagged as effective_offers.\n",

However, for those transctions where offer_completed=0, I have not considered them, and this could be a potential feature to include, as a proxy for the 'baseline' level of spending for a user.\n",

    "Checking on the feature importance to analyse the main drivers of an effective offer, we can see that the most important driver of effective offers across all three are the tenure of membership i.e. the longer the customer as a member of Starbucks, the more likely (s)he will respond to the offer they receive. And, the 2nd most important feature is income for each of the three models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a BOGO offer, the membership tenure is the most important feature, and the other variables are a lot smaller in proportions. Income, age and offer_received_cnt are the 2nd, 3rd and 4th most important features, but their proportions are very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a discount offer, after the membership tenure, age and income are the next most important variables. But it is still very small in proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature importances for the informational offer models are more distributed compared to the BOGO and discount models, with income being the 2nd most important feature. Age is the third and social channel interestingly being the 4th."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, I found this project challenging, mainly due to the structure of the data in the transcript dataset. I had started out with 2 business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the main features influencing the effectiveness of an offer on the Starbucks app?\n",
    "Could the data provided, namely offer characteristics and user demographics, predict whether a user would take up an offer?\n",
    "### a. Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Question 1 findings:\n",
    "For Question 1, the feature importance given by all 3 models were that the tenure of a member is the biggest predictor of the effectiveness of an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all three models, the top 3 variables were the same - membership tenure, income and age. However, income and age switched orders depending on offer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For BOGO and discount offers, the distribution of feature importances were relatively equal. However, for informational offers, the distribution is slightly more balanced, with income the second most important variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Question 2 findings:\n",
    "My decision to use 3 separate models to predict the effectiveness of each offer type ended up with good accuracy for the BOGO and discount models (82.87% for BOGO and 87.38% for discount), while slightly less accurate performance for informational offers (75.23%). However, I would regard 75% as acceptable in a business setting, as for informational offers, there is no cost involved to inform users of a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, for BOGO and discount models, I am quite happy with the 80% and above accuracy, as in a business setting that would be acceptable to show offers to people, even if the model misclassifies a few, the overall revenue increase might justify the few mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Main challenges and potential improvement:\n",
    "When analysing and building the machine learning models to answer the above questions, reflections on my main challenges and findings are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Attribution framework for assigning offer_ids for transactions:\n",
    "In order to answer Question 1, I had to first define what an 'effective offer' means using the transactional records. This proved to be the trickiest portion of the project. I had to define a funnel for what what an effective conversion would look like, as we had data on both effective and noneffective conversions. Thus, I was desigining an attribution model for the conversion events (offer completed and transaction events) based on the events that occurred prior for each person.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up having to separate the users into 4 different pools, based on their actions in the transcript data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 1: People who are influenced by offers and thus purchase/complete the offer(successful/effective conversion of offer)\n",
    "Group 2: People who receive and an offer but is not influenced and thus no conversion event (ineffective conversion of offer)\n",
    "Group 3: People who have conversion events but was not actually influenced by an offer\n",
    "Group 4: People who receive offers but no views or action taken\n",
    "Even after separating the groups, it was challenging to assign the people in group 3 based on the transactional data. I had to define the event space where the right sequence of events would occur before I could assign an offer id to transactions (which did not have an offer_id), essentally designing a event/sequence-based attribution window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Feature engineering:\n",
    "Deciding on what features to re-engineer and how to engineer for an effective model. At the end, our reengineered feature of membership tenure was indeed the most important feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. Model implementation decisions:\n",
    "I had made the decision to build 3 separate models depending on offer types based on my definition of the problem statement - as I wanted to discover what would drive an effective offer, I thought it made more sense to remove noise from the data by separating the data into the offer types. My decision ended up to be quite a good one as the single BOGO and discount models got good performance in testing scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the info model, the accuracy was slightly worse as we had less records overall. As elaborated above, I believe that if we had more data, I could have gotten the accuracy higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional note on model selection - I selected tree-based models as I wanted to assess feature importance, but I could have extended this study further by testing a parametric/ regression model (e.g. logistic regression for classification tasks). The weights of the coefficients from a regression model might have been interesting to contrast with the feature importance of a tree-based model, given that both models have different ways of analysing the data. The feature membership_tenure_days might not have been the highest weighted feature, in contrast to how it was in this study."

    "## Further Improvements and Experimentation\n",
    "Due to time reasons, I couldn't get a chance to try some other enhancement in the step of model tuning. For example, probably, I can do some more experiment on feature engineering step to see if any other new features can improve the model, also I could also try to reduce some feature to see how it will affect the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, so far the analysis is focused more on customer's who successfully finish the transaction after they received the offer, there should be more insight for the other cases where the customer finishes the transactions regardless of the offer. If we could get any insight into those cases, maybe we can send out more offers to those customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I was thinking if I could do some unsupervised learning on clustering the customers based on information we are given, to see if there are any specific characteristics on a group of customers who will be more likely to respond to the offer."
